# dijkstraimplementation
In this project dijkstra algorithm of finding the shortest path is implemented using a real example.
The idea was to work with some map API and find a shortest path between two points.
The work is done as a web project with client and server side.
2GIS API is taken on frontend to work with coordinates and Java Spring on backend to receive coordinates and use dijkstra on them.
Client and server connect with each other by sending JSON files.

The work originally is a laboratory work from university.
